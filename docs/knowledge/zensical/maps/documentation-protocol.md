# Documentation Protocol

## Rule
No substantial code/delivery step is complete without synchronized documentation.

## Mandatory checklist
1. `TODO-CODEX.md` updated with task IDs, dependencies, Jira, and statuses.
2. `worklog.md` updated with what changed and why.
3. `worklog.json` updated with structured evidence.
4. `AGENTS.md` updated when process/quality expectations evolve.

## Evidence requirements
For release-level milestones, include:
1. Git commit reference.
2. Git tag reference (if created).
3. Validation command(s) executed.
4. Result summary.

## Current enforcement status
Active as of 2026-02-14.
